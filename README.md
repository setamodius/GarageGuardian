# Garage Guardian

Garage Guardian is an ESP32-based BLE access control system designed to simplify garage and door access while improving security.

The system connects to one or more iTAG BLE remotes and listens for button notifications. When an authorized device triggers an event, the ESP32 activates an electric strike for a configurable period of time, allowing the door to be opened.

The project was created with a simple goal:

> Build a reliable, low-cost, offline access control system using readily available components.
